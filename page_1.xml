      <pText><![CDATA[Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python source code is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is now maintained by a core development team at the National Research Institute. Python is a versatile language which is easy to script and easy to read. It doesnâ€™t have strict rules for syntax. Python is open source and it forms a strong backbone to build large applications. We can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment if we have a GUI application on our system that supports Python. IDLE is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. Its installation comes with integrated development environment for programming. Other examples for Python IDE are Spyder, PyCharm etc. All the programs in this book follow Python 3.4.3 for Windows.]]></pText>
